Volatilty

Strength of move.
When price goes up or down, there is an increase in volatility.
When price moves sideways, volatility is low.
The more volatility in a large move, the more interest or pressure there is reinforcing that move. (Calculate volatility amount?)

- Keltner channels
- Average True Volatilty (only works looking at charts, value changes per price value)


Oscillators

Signals: buy or sell

- MACD: positive means increasing trend. MACD intersection with signal line, if MACD going down, sell signal
- KST: smoother than MACD, use this. Find how to calculate ove bought and oversold lines
- Swing Index. Only for short trading, many signals
- RSI



Trend detection

- Accumulated Swing Index: confirmation of trend. Not very smooth, little information about future deicions
- DMI: ADX shows trend strength and DMI+ shows upward if > 0 and DMI - shows downward if > 0.
if they cross, there is a reversal. Good as a complement, for trend direction and strength confirmation

Volume

Confirm trends

- On-Balance Volume (OBV): Cumulative volume. Adding on high volume, subtracting on low volume
If OBV is rising and price isn't, price is likely to follow the OBV and start rising. If price is rising and OBV is flat-lining or falling, the price may be near a top. If the price is falling and OBV is flat-lining or rising, the price could be nearing a bottom.
